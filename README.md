# goliath
A 3D VideoGame idea that I undertook in High School to learn the programming language of C#

Goliath demonstrates my ability to use arrays, vectors and values within C#

The game has three stages. 

Stage 1 involves the character hopping onto pillars to try and get a key. This key is then used to open the door to a tomb. 

Stage 2 transports the user to a tomb, where they are then able to pick up the rock and sling. 

Stage 3 is after they grab the weapon they are able to face Goliath in a 1 on 1 Boss fight, where they can press space bar to throw rocks at Goliath. 

Because of the way the game is designed, you can only win if you hit Goliath square in the head. So to do this you must jump onto the sides of the map and aim higher than where he actually is, taking into account the trajectory of the rock, which was a feature I implemented into the code. 

If you make improvements I would love to hear/see them!
